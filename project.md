# ELPV dataset classification

## Introduction

### Challenges

This dataset contains 2 types of image, namely mono and poly. Each type furthur devided to 4 classes, each class representing different degree of defect. The dataset is highly imbalanced, with the number of "0,0" defect is dominating the databse (about half of the dataset). The dataset is also quite noisy, its really hard for human to distinguish the image especially for "0.33" and "0.67", and they are look very similar. 

After review the dataset, using tradition machine learning method
